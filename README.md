# Customer Behavior Analysis using Decision Tree

## üöÄ **Project Overview**
In this project, we explore customer behavior patterns using a **Decision Tree** classification model. By analyzing customer data such as demographics, interests, and platform usage, our goal is to predict customer behavior and provide valuable insights for business decisions.

This project includes **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **data preprocessing**, and the application of machine learning techniques using the **Decision Tree** algorithm. By the end, we aim to build a robust model capable of predicting customer behavior based on various features.

## üîß **Technologies Used**
- **Python**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib** for data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning (Decision Tree Classifier)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for development and visualization

## üìä **Project Workflow**
1. **Data Collection & Exploration**
   - Importing and loading the customer dataset.
   - Performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the structure, distributions, and potential relationships within the data.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and encoding categorical variables (like gender, platform, etc.) into numeric values.
   - Scaling features if necessary to improve model performance.

3. **Modeling & Evaluation**
   - Building a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict customer behavior.
   - Evaluating the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and other classification metrics like precision and recall.

4. **Model Interpretation**
   - Visualizing the **Decision Tree** to understand the decision-making process.
   - Analyzing feature importance to see which factors influence customer behavior the most.

5. **Results & Insights**
   - Drawing actionable insights from the model results to help businesses understand customer preferences and behaviors.
